Todo for build:
---------------
	- Get demo.c working to test the build
	- Add translation support
	- Pass path info to code so it knows where to find config files
	- Get GTK-DOC working with autotools
	- Create a Git repository
	- Get setup for building debs (using Debian's build helpers)
	- Add license & readme
	- Make sure Vala stuff is done properly (checks for vapi files, etc)
	- Language bindings (g-i) for Python and friends

Todo for library:
-----------------
	- Add custom icons to fold margin
	- Use proper config dirs (~/.config/gtkeditor maybe?)
	- Write more lexer classes, try and come up with a better way than
	  doing it manually.
	- Write more top level and sub lexer config files
	- Fix bug with color (changes when saved)
	- Add custom context menu to editor
	- Fixup demo.c to use GtkBuilder and have a good UI
	- See if gio is really needed, stdlib stuff should be fine
		- Needed for GKeyFile?
	- Add editor preferences to config files along with existing lexer
	  configuration stuff
	- Come up with a way (GUI or otherwise) to allow easily customizing
	  color schemes.
	- Support CTags, TagManager or some other tokenizer
	- Add support for call-tips
	- Add support for auto-completion/popup
	- Add code to detect filetypes and select appropriate lexer
	- Lots of other stuff :)
